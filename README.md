Genetic Algorithm for Generating Difficult Mazes
============

Group project from CS51 implementing a Genetic Algorithm for creating difficult mazes. 
Heuristic is one of a couple Maze Solvers.
Maze Generator parameters are manipulated by the Genetic Algorithm based on the output of the Heuristic.
Algorithm terminates when a plateau in progress is reached.
